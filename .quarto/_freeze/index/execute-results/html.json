It will check to see if you have all the required libraries.  It then installs missing ones and then loads them into memory (so we do not get those stupid package startup messages).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsource(\"package_loader.R\")\n\nlibraries <- extract_libraries_from_markdown()\nneed_to_install <- check_missing_packages( libraries )\ninstall_missing_packages( need_to_install )\nfor( pkg in libraries ) { \n  suppressPackageStartupMessages( library(pkg, character.only = TRUE) )\n}\nggplot2::theme_set( theme_minimal( base_size=16) )\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
