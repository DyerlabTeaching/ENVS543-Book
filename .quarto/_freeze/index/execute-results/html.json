Enrollment is restricted to students with graduate standing or those with one course in statistics and permission of the instructor. Develop quantitative skills for the visualization, manipulation, analysis, and communication of environmental \"big data.\" This course focuses on spatial environmental data analysis, interpretation, and communication, using real-time data from the Rice Rivers Center and the R statistical analysis environment.\n\n<img src=\"media/dyer.png\" align=\"right\"/>\n\nAs both a student and instructor in statistics classes, I found I spent a vast amount of time and effort describing the characteristics of statistics (derivations, expectations, etc.). This is perfectly fine; it is important on many levels to make sure that practitioners understand the basis and context of all the kinds of analyses they use. However, the drawback here, in my experience, is that once you've spent a semester or year getting all this knowledge under your belt, and you can easily demonstrate your understanding of the parameters in a model, you cannot actually work with real data. This class is designed to produce practitioners of data analysis.\n\n## Workflow in Data Analysis\n\nTo understand data analytics, one needs to recognize the entire workflow. Below is a brief graphical depiction of how analysis actually works—in the real world. In this class, we will work on all of these components using the open-source R language.\n\n-   **Collect:** Getting data from an external source into a format that you can use is often the most time-consuming step in the analysis. The content of this class will provide training in data import from local, online, and database sources.\\\n-   **Visualize:** Visualizing data is key to understanding. In the image below, notice that the variables X and Y in all the displayed data sets have equivalent means, standard deviations, and correlation up to 2 decimal places! We will emphasize visualization, both static and dynamic, throughout this class.\n-   **Transform:** Pulling data into your analysis ecosystem is not sufficient. Often the data need to be reformatted and reconfigured before it is actually usable.\n-   **Model:** The application of models to subsets of data is often the step that takes the least amount of time and effort. However, the application of a model to data is not the endpoint. The model must be visualized and, many times, the underlying data or derivate data must be transformed and submitted to subsequent models.\n-   **Communicate:** The effort we put into research and analyses is meaningless without effective communication of your data and findings to a broad audience. Here we will focus on how to develop effective data communication strategies and formats.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n\n<img src=\"media/workflow.png\"/>\n\n</p>\n\n## Learning Objectives\n\nThe purpose of this course is to help you build your data skills and to develop a foundational understanding upon which subsequent courses will build. The overarching goal here is to develop a working knowledge of the R statistical computing language and enough proficiency to import raw data and then iterate through the visualization, manipulation, and analysis steps in the creation of output that is easily communicated to a scientific audience.\n\nThe content of this course is built upon the following general Ctudent Learning Objectives (CLO):\n\n### CLO 1: Use R to perform reproducible data analysis workflows across environmental contexts\n> Students will demonstrate functional fluency in using R and its associated libraries (e.g., Tidyverse, Quarto) for data import, transformation, visualization, and analysis, establishing a generalizable skillset for quantitative inquiry.\n  - *Bloom's Level:* Apply / Analyze\n  - *Reinforces:* Seeing R as a tool for thinking and doing, not just syntax or statistical analysis\n  - *Notes:* This aligns with the practical literacy needed to \"think with data\" in a coding environment. It emphasizes generalized fluency over memorization or syntax drills.\n \n\n### CLO 2: Analyze and interpret commonly encountered environmental data and associated analyses using appropriate exploratory and statistical techniques\n> Students will apply foundational exploratory and statistical approaches (e.g., binomial models, contingency tables, regression, spatial summaries) to common ecological, environmental, and evolutionary datasets to support data-driven inference.\n  - *Bloom's Level:* Analyze / Evaluate\n  - *Reinforces:* Judgment in data workflows, including exploratory iteration and critique.\n  - *Notes:* This keeps the emphasis on doing the analysis and interpreting results, not on statistical derivation of model components. It fits the framing: \"not a stats class\" but \"using common tools to make sense of real data.\" It also creates space for iteration and model refinement, aligning with the \"model, visualize, refine\" approach.\n \n\n### CLO 3: Communicate data-driven findings using publication-quality scientific writing and visualizations.\n> Students will produce clear, compelling, and reproducible documents that communicate quantitative findings, formatted according to scientific norms and using tools like Quarto and Markdown.\n  - *Bloom's Level:* Create\n  - *Reinforces:* Scientific communication and agile presentation of quantitative and qualitative information in industry-standard formats.\n  - *Notes:* This grounds communication in scientific practice, where students must compose and format their insights clearly and rigorously. It ties tightly into how you assess work (\"as if submitting for publication\") and emphasizes narrative data fluency, not just procedural results.\n\n\n## Course Content & Assessment\n\nThis course is designed as a sequence of individual, stand-alone modules. Each is self-contained and includes a lecture, slides, a larger narrative document, a video demonstration, and an assessment.\n\n## Logistics\n\n-   Course Instructor: Professor Rodney Dyer\n-   Email: [rjdyer\\@vcu.edu](mailto://rjdyer@vcu.edu)\n-   Webpage: [rodneydyer.com](https://rodneydyer.com).\n\n## Required Materials\n\nThis course requires that you bring your own laptop or other computing device that is capable of running RStudio and the R statistical language. There is no required book and all content is provided via online resources.\n\n## Assignments & Grading Policy\n\nThe grade for this course is based upon the totality of the points gained for all assignments, as well as a single large data analysis project that will be due at the end of the semester. This final will account for 10% of your overall grade. Grades will be determined using the normal 10% scale:   \n- A (>= 90%),  \n- B (>= 80% & < 90%),  \n- C (>= 70% & < 80%),\n- D (>= 60% & < 70%), and\n- F (< 60%).\n\nAll percentages are concrete, and scores will be rounded to the nearest integer; no extra credit will be given.\n\n## Late Policy\n\nAll of the content in this class is given as take-home assignments and tests. You will have a full 7 days to complete and turn in the work. The intention here is to give you more than sufficient time to complete the work because we do not rush data analysis. On the due date, I will post the answers so you can check your work. After the answers are posted, there will be no points awarded for late work.\n\n## Attendance Policy\n\nAll content is provided as slides, handouts, and video content. Much of the work in this class will be conducted during the in-class session. As such, you must show up to class if you intend to get the content. Data analysis is a hands-on experience, and the more doing it you engage in it, the more efficient you will become.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nNote that the specifics of this Course Syllabus may be changed at any time during the semester. You will be responsible for abiding by any such changes that are communicated to you via email, course announcement, and/or posting in the course discussion forums.\n\n## VCU Policies\n\nStudents should visit http://go.vcu.edu/syllabus and review all syllabus statement information.

Faculty may not give an examination or an assignment on those days. Instead, students are encouraged to use these days for relaxation, study, and/or review of class materials.\n\n## Academic Success and Integrity\n\n### Honor System: upholding academic integrity\n\nThe VCU Honor System policy describes the responsibilities of students, faculty, and administration in upholding academic integrity. According to this policy, \"Members of the academic community are required to conduct themselves in accordance with the highest standards of academic honesty, ethics, and integrity at all times.\" <a href=\"https://conduct.students.vcu.edu/vcu-honor-system/\">Students are expected to read the policy in full and learn about requirements</a>.\n\n### Early academic alerts\n\nVCU’s <a href=\"https://semss.vcu.edu/for-faculty-and-staff/early-notification-programs/#:~:text=VCU's%20Early%20Notification%20Programs%20help,students%20early%20in%20the%20semester.\">Early Notification Program</a> supports student success. If, as an instructor, I am concerned about your academic engagement or performance in the first few weeks of class, you may receive a Progress Report email encouraging you to reach out to me after class or during student hours (office hours) for additional support. As a community of care, your <a href=\"https://uaa.vcu.edu/services/appointments/\">academic advisor</a>, the <a href=\"https://writing.vcu.edu/\">Writing Center</a>, and the <a href=\"https://clc.vcu.edu/\">Campus Learning Center</a> may also follow up to provide additional layers of support.\n\n### Students with disabilities\n\nVCU is committed to ensuring that all students maintain equal access to all aspects of the university, including educational experiences through the provision of reasonable accommodations and academic adjustments. In addition to being a requirement under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act, this speaks directly to VCU's mission of inclusion, equity, and access. To receive accommodations or other disability-related supports, students must register with the Office of Student Accessibility and Educational Opportunity on the Monroe Park Campus (828-2253) or the Division for Academic Success on the MCV campus (828-9782). Students and faculty can visit the <a href=\"https://saeo.vcu.edu/\">Student Accessibility and Educational Opportunity website</a> and/or the <a href=\"https://das.vcu.edu/\">Division for Academic Success website</a> for additional information. Once students have completed the registration process, they will be provided with a letter of accommodation. They should provide a copy to their instructor(s) and attempt to schedule a meeting to discuss the implementation of accommodations as early in the semester as possible.\n\n### Career Services\n\nLooking for ways to tie what you are learning in your class to your future career or professional goals? <a href=\"http://www.careers.vcu.edu/\">VCU Career Services</a> provides career planning services for all current VCU students and alumni. Career Services can help students with finding a work-study job on/off campus, resume writing, internship development, interviewing, preparing for graduate school, networking, or job searching. Students are invited to attend career events and workshops and schedule individualized career advising appointments.\n\n## Registration, Attendance, and Financial Responsibilities\n\n### Class registration is required for attendance\n\nStudents may attend only those classes for which they have registered. Faculty may not add students to class rosters. If students are attending a class for which they have not registered, they must stop attending.\n\n### Attendance and consequences of poor attendance\n\nThe instructional programs at VCU are based upon a series of class meetings involving lectures, discussions, field experiences, special readings, and reporting assignments. Therefore, it is important for each student to be in attendance regularly. A student who misses a class session is responsible for completing all material covered or assignments made during the absence.\n\n-   Students having attendance problems should contact their instructor to explain the reasons for nonattendance and to discuss the feasibility of continuing in the course. If the student has fallen so far behind that the successful completion of the course is impossible, the student should withdraw from the course before the end of the first 10 weeks of classes (by Oct. 28, 2022).\n\n-   If the student continues to miss class and does not officially withdraw from the course, the instructor may withdraw the student for nonattendance with a mark of “W'' before the end of the first 10 weeks of classes or may assign an academic grade at the end. Withdrawals are not permitted after the end of the first 10 weeks of classes. For classes that do not conform to the semester calendar, the final withdrawal date occurs when half of the course has been completed.\n\n### Withdrawal from classes\n\nBefore withdrawing from classes, students should consult their instructor as well as other appropriate university offices. Withdrawing from classes may negatively impact a student’s financial aid award and his or her semester charges. To discuss financial aid and the student bill, contact the <a href=\"https://sfmc.vcu.edu/contactsfmc/ramq/\">Student Financial Management Center (RAMQ)</a> regarding the impact on your financial aid.\n\n### Military short-term training or deployment\n\nIf military students receive orders for short-term training or for deployment/mobilization, they should inform and present their orders to Military Student Services and to their professor(s). For further information on policies and procedures, contact <a href=\"https://militaryservices.vcu.edu/\">Military Student Services</a> at 828-5993.\n\n### Students representing the university – excused absences\n\nStudents who represent the university (athletes and others) do not choose their schedules. All student-athletes should provide their schedules to their instructors at the beginning of the semester. The Intercollegiate Athletic Council strongly encourages faculty to treat missed classes or exams (because of a scheduling conflict) as excused absences and urges faculty to work with the students to make up the work or exam.\n\n### Student financial responsibility\n\n<a href=\"https://sfmc.vcu.edu/contactsfmc/ramq/\">Students assume the responsibility of full payment</a> of tuition and fees generated from their registration, all charges for housing and dining services, and other applicable miscellaneous charges. Students are ultimately responsible for any unpaid balance on their account as a result of the University Financial Aid Office or their third-party sponsor canceling or reducing their award(s).\n\n## Technology\n\n### Computer and network use\n\nAll students are expected to know and comply with <a href=\"https://policy.vcu.edu/universitywide-policies/policies/computer-and-network-resources-use.html\">VCU's Computer and Network Use policy.</a>\n\n### Student email standard\n\nEmail is considered an official method of communication at VCU. Students are expected to check their official VCU email on a frequent and consistent basis (the university recommends daily) in order to remain informed of university-related communications. Students are responsible for the consequences of not reading, in a timely fashion, university-related communications sent to their official VCU student email account. Mail sent to the VCU email address may include notification of university-related actions, including disciplinary action. <a href=\"https://ts.vcu.edu/media/technology-services/assets/content-assets/university-resources/ts-groups/information-security/StudentEmailStandard.pdf\">Students must read this standard in its entirety.</a>\n\n### Faculty communication with students\n\nVCU instructional faculty, administrators, and staff maintain confidentiality of student records and disclose information in accordance with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). This means that VCU officials may disclose student record information without the consent of the student in certain situations. To support university operations, for example, VCU officials share information about students with other educational officials as necessary to perform their job duties. FERPA permits this disclosure to school officials who have a legitimate educational interest in the student information. In addition, VCU officials have obligations to report information shared by a student depending on the content of that information, for example, in compliance with VCU’s policy on the duty to report. Unless FERPA permits a certain disclosure, VCU generally requires consent from a student to disclose information from their education record to another individual. You may find additional information on the <a href=\"https://rar.vcu.edu/records/family-educational-rights-and-privacy-act/\">VCU FERPA website.</a>\n\n## Important dates\n\nImportant dates for the current and future semesters are listed in the <a href=\"https://academiccalendars.vcu.edu/\">VCU Academic Calendar.</a>\n\n\n\n## Logistics\n\nThis is a Quarto book created from lecture materials in ENVS543: Environmental Data Literacy.\n\nDownload the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/DyerlabTeaching/ENVS543-Book) as a Zip file or create a new RStudio project by cloning the whole project (e.g., `File -> New Project -> Version Control -> Git`). \n\nThe following code runs each time you render the project.  It will check to see if you have all the required libraries.  It then installs missing ones and then loads them into memory (so we do not get those stupid package startup messages).\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsource(\"package_loader.R\")\n\nlibraries <- extract_libraries_from_markdown()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nWarning in file(con, \"r\"): 'raw = FALSE' but './narrative_datatypes_files' is\nnot a regular file\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nWarning in file(con, \"r\"): cannot open file './narrative_datatypes_files': it\nis a directory\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nWarning in value[[3L]](cond): Error reading file ./narrative_datatypes_files:\ncannot open the connection\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nWarning in file(con, \"r\"): 'raw = FALSE' but './narrative_factors_files' is not\na regular file\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nWarning in file(con, \"r\"): cannot open file './narrative_factors_files': it is\na directory\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nWarning in value[[3L]](cond): Error reading file ./narrative_factors_files:\ncannot open the connection\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nWarning in file(con, \"r\"): 'raw = FALSE' but './narrative_markdown_files 2' is\nnot a regular file\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nWarning in file(con, \"r\"): cannot open file './narrative_markdown_files 2': it\nis a directory\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nWarning in value[[3L]](cond): Error reading file ./narrative_markdown_files 2:\ncannot open the connection\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nneed_to_install <- check_missing_packages( libraries )\ninstall_missing_packages( need_to_install )\nfor( pkg in libraries ) { \n  suppressPackageStartupMessages( library(pkg, character.only = TRUE) )\n}\nggplot2::theme_set( theme_minimal( base_size=16) )\n```\n:::\n",
